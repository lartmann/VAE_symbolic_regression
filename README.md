#  Sampling Equations From Variational Autoencoder Embeddings: A Novel Approach to Symbolic Regression

This repository contains the code for symbolic regression with (Variational) Autoencoders. 

The approach with n-hot encoded equation elements is implemented in the `training_ecv.ipynb` and the approach with one-hot encoded function terms is implemented in the `training_ecv_classify.ipynb`. The notebook `visualizations_of_results.ipynb` shows the visualizations of the systematic parameter evaluation. The folder `src` contains all the necessary additional functions.
